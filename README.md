# 5327S Stats Displayer
5327S Stats Displayer Python GUI

## Purpose
A GUI application I created to provide a visual interface to display the statistics of any vrc team in the world. This allowed our team to quickly and efficiently find out which possible alliance partner would have the most positive effect on our overall alliance. Using this application, we could quickly get a visual on how a team can perform based off of their previous tournaments. This stats displayer uses VEX DB to collect its data and works with any registered team in the world.
